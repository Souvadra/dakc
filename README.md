# Asynchronous Distributed Memory Parallel $k$-mer counting Algorithm

This is the global repository of all the software developed by the authors. Each directory contains a seperate README file.

## Directory Structure and Explanation

- **/dakc**: Directory for the the asynchronous $k$-mer counting implementation of `DAKC`.
- **/microbenchmarks**: Benchmark programs used to obtain system parameters for modeling asynchronous $k$-mer counting in distributed memory.
- **/pakman_star**: Cleaned up and faster version of PakMan (obtained from the original GitHub repository).
- **/syngen**: Programs used to generated synthetic datasets used in our paper.
