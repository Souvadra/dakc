# Synthetic Dataset Generation Steps
1. Compile and execute `inputgenerator.cpp` to generate `Synthetic 20` to `Synthetic 30` ground truth genomes (`.fa` files). Each genome generated as output of this program is a uniform random string of $2^{NUM}$ length sampled from the $\Sigma = \{A,T,C,G\}$ alphabet.
2. Execute `synthetic_generator.sh` script to use ART Illumina simulator and generate Illumina like `FASTQ` files. The output will be named similar to `file_1.fq` and `file_2.fq`. For the synthetic datasets, we can merge both files into a single `file_combined.fq` file, since the paired ended information is not used in $k$-mer counting benchmark.
3. Inside each directory generated by `synthetic_generator.sh`, execute `fq2famaker.sh` to convert the `.fq` file input into `.fa` format (needed by HySortK and PakMan), and execute `fq2txtmaker.sh` to convert them into header removed `.txt` format (needed by DAKC).
